Election Data Project - Polls (2016 General Election: Trump vs. Clinton)
In this Data Project I will be looking at data from the 2016 election.

In this project I will analyze the results of political polls. I will analyze this aggregated poll data and answer some questions:

1.) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation? 2.) Did the poll results favor Trump or Hillary? 3.) How do undecided voters effect the poll? 4.) Can we account for the undecided voters? 5.) How did voter sentiment change over time? 6.) Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
